The Debian Package casperjs
----------------------------

CasperJS is an open source navigation scripting & testing utility
written in Javascript and based on PhantomJS â€” the scriptable headless
WebKit engine. It eases the process of defining a full navigation
scenario and provides useful high-level functions, methods & syntactic
sugar for doing common tasks
